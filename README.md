# ATM System
The java program developed here is to implement ATM Bank functionality. The user can create an account, check,  deposit money, withdraw, and also search account with the system.


## Software Framework
The software employs HTML for rendering the operation page and utilizes MySQL for reading and storing data. 
The servlet operates on the Web server or application server, acting as an intermediary layer between the HTTP client's request and the database on the HTTP server.
